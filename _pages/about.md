# About

Hi! I'm Alex, a prospective student of [Glasgow Kelvin College](https://glasgowkelvin.ac.uk), where I hope to study Social Care. I'm just a young person with drive to help other people as much as I can. I have a background in computer science and music.

I write a lot of open-source code because I depend on a lot of open source code and want to make sure others can do the same. I believe that it's a useful and highly important community and I would like to ensure that it is accessible by all.
